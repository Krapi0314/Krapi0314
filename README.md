## Hi, I'm Kevin Park ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a software developer specializing in Go and Java-based web server application development, K8s and AWS-based backend architecture design and infrastructure deployment, and JS and TS-based web application prototyping.

I'm also an open source maintainer of [Yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie-team) and a member of [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and [Istio](https://github.com/istio), and have many other open source activities.

I'm interested in server-related topics such as backend, DevOps, infrastructure, distributed systems, and architecture, and I love to share my knowledge through contributing and mentoring.
