## Hi, I'm Kevin Park ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a backend developer interested in Distributed Systems, System Design, Infrastructure, and DevOps/FinOps. But I also do frontend stuff too.
I'm also a open source contributer of [Yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie), [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), and [Kuberentes Sig Docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/website). I'm looking forward to contribute on more open source projects.
I love to optimize and organize many things, both my lifestyle and development.
I also love to share my knowledge and skills to the world, with mentoring and contributing.
