## Hi, I'm Kevin Park ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a Backend/DevOps developer interested in distributed systems, system design, infrastructure, and cloud native. But I also do frontend stuff too.
I'm also an open source maintainer of [Yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie-team) and a member of [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and [Istio](https://github.com/istio). I'm looking forward to contributing to more open source projects.
I love to optimize and organize many things, both my lifestyle and my development.
I also love to share my knowledge and skills with the world through mentoring and contributing.
