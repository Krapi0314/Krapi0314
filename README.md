## Hi, I'm Kevin Park ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a backend/devops developer interested in distributed systems, system design, infrastructure, and cloud native. But I also do frontend stuff too.
I'm also an open source member/contributor of [Yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie-team), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes), [Istio](https://github.com/istio), and [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw). I'm looking forward to contributing to more open source projects.
I love to optimize and organize many things, both my lifestyle and my development.
I also love to share my knowledge and skills with the world through mentoring and contributing.
